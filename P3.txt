Description:
    This project is simple web server that is written in nodejs. The server
    performs 3 basic actions:

        1. UNLINK: removes a file (if it exists)
        2. SIZE: returns the size of a file (if it exists)
        3. FETCH: returns the contents of a file (if it exists)

    To run this, simply navigate to the directory where myhttp.js is located
    and type the command "node myhttp.js". This will start the server locally
    on the randomly selected port (portnum). See the console for the port, and
    then go on your browser and navigate to "localhost:(portnum)". Here you can
    perform the 3 basic actions on files located in the WEBSERVER folder, as
    long as the URL is correct.

Questions:
    1. It doesn't matter - the port is the locally allocated (localhost). If
    it were on the cs server, this error would show: Error! EADDRNOTAVAIL.

    2. I get no error messages for running
